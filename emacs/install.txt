To install Emacs, it's better to build from source for performance.

Last time https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos worked wonders.
Just clone the repo, run
`brew bundle`
then
`./build-emacs-for-macos emacs-28.2`
This will generate a build in the /builds folder.

After that, the app needs to be codesigned. Just run
`codesign --force --deep -s - Emacs.app`
Then copy the Emacs.app folder into the /Applications folder.

It would be nice to have a script automatize this, but I'm too lazy.
